Compiling module com.hala.mywebapp.App
   Unification traversed 1006 fields and methods and 428 types. 40 are considered part of the current module and 48 had all of their fields and methods traversed.
   [WARN] Some stale types ([com.hala.mywebapp.ScriviStoria$2, com.hala.mywebapp.ScriviStoria$3, com.hala.mywebapp.ScriviStoria$1]) were not reprocessed as was expected. This is either a compiler bug or a Generator has legitimately stopped creating these types.
