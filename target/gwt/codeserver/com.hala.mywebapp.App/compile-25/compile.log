   Unification traversed 994 fields and methods and 466 types. 26 are considered part of the current module and 34 had all of their fields and methods traversed.
   [WARN] Some stale types ([com.hala.mywebapp.ScriviStoria_ScriviStoriaUiBinderImpl, com.hala.mywebapp.ScriviStoria_ScriviStoriaUiBinderImpl$Widgets]) were not reprocessed as was expected. This is either a compiler bug or a Generator has legitimately stopped creating these types.
