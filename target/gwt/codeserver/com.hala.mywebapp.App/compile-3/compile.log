Compiling module com.hala.mywebapp.App
   Unification traversed 701 fields and methods and 363 types. 10 are considered part of the current module and 18 had all of their fields and methods traversed.
   [WARN] Some stale types ([com.hala.mywebapp.GreetingService_Proxy, com.hala.mywebapp.App$1, com.hala.mywebapp.App$1MyHandler$1, com.hala.mywebapp.App$1MyHandler]) were not reprocessed as was expected. This is either a compiler bug or a Generator has legitimately stopped creating these types.
